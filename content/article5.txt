Yea and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mothers ovaries! You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games? Lemme hear everybody say hey-yo! All the ladies say yeaaah! Everybody over thirty do this with your hand! Everybody with a red shirt jump up and down! Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an L who isn't hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times teeenn! You look it up, you don't- you don't even know what it means.
